# libleak

`libleak` detects memory leak by hooking memory functions (e.g. `malloc`)
by LD_PRELOAD.

There is no need to modify or re-compile the target program, and you can
enable/disable the detection during target running.

In fact `libleak` can not identify memory leak, while it just takes the
memory as leak if it lives longer than a threshold. The threshold is 60
second by default, but you should set it according to your scenarios.

There is less impact on performance, compared with `valgrind` and `memleax`.

It prints the full call-stack at suspicious memory leak point, and easier
to use, compared with other similar libraries (e.g. `mtrace`).

# LICENCE

GPLv2

# OS-MACHINE

- GNU/Linux only by now. But FreeBSD should be OK with some code changing

- x86_64 is only tested by now. But others should be OK.


# BUILD FROM SOURCE

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/WuBingzheng/libleak.git
    $ cd libleak
    $ make

# USAGE

### basic

1. [Download](https://github.com/WuBingzheng/libleak/releases) or build the shared-object `libleak.so`.

2. change the permission: $ chmod a+x libleak.so

3. touch the output file: $ touch ./a.out

4. Run the target program:

        $ LD_PRELOAD=/path/of/libleak.so ./a.out

5. Then you will read output in `/tmp/libleak.$pid` in time.

### set expire threshold

As said above, you should set expire threshold according to your scenarios.

For example, if you are debugging an HTTP server with keepalive, and there are
connections last for more than 5 minutes, you should set the threshold to 300
second to cover it.
If your program is expected to free every memory in 1 second, you should set
the threshold to 2 to get report in time.

The threshold is set by environment variable `LEAK_EXPIRE` (in second, default is 60):

    $ LD_PRELOAD=/path/of/libleak.so LEAK_EXPIRE=300 ./a.out

Besides, the threshold will be increased if any memory block is freed after
expiration, with `LEAK_AUTO_EXPIRE` enabled (default is disabled):

    $ LD_PRELOAD=/path/of/libleak.so LEAK_AUTO_EXPIRE=1 ./a.out

### enable/disable detection during running

`libleak` begins the detection at the very beginning of target process running
by default. However you can enable/disable the detection during running by
setting `LEAK_PID_CHECK` and `LEAK_PID_FILE`:

    $ LD_PRELOAD=/path/of/libleak.so LEAK_PID_CHECK=10 ./a.out

`LEAK_PID_CHECK` set the interval (in second, default is 0) to check `LEAK_PID_FILE`.

`LEAK_PID_FILE` (default is `/tmp/libleak.enabled`) contains target pids:
one pid each line, no empty line, no comment line.
You can add or delete pids to/from this file during running.

To enable detecting process pid=1234:

    $ echo 1234 >> /tmp/libleak.enabled

To disable detecting process pid=1234:

    $ sed -i '/1234/d' /tmp/libleak.enabled

### for multi-thread program

`libleak` is multi-thread safe.

### for multi-process program

Log file will be created for each process.

Besides you can choose which processes to be detect by `LEAK_PID_FILE`
and `LEAK_PID_CHECK` said above.

### set the log

The log file is set by `LEAK_LOG_FILE` (default is `/tmp/libleak.$pid`).

There is also a statistics report when disabled or target normal termination,
either via exit(3) or via return from the main().
